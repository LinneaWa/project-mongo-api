# Project Mongo API

Create a RESTful API which make use of Mongoose models to model data and use these models to fetch data from the database.

## The problem

I learned how to 
✓ model data in Mongo using Mongoose
✓ store secret information such as database passwords
✓ return useful error messages from your API endpoints
✓ fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
✓ seed large amounts of data to a database
✓ Deploy on google cloud and Mongo DB Atlas

## Endpoints

Find song by ID
      "path": "/song/id/:id"
